If one were to do all A-Sides deathless, they must be done in order, as 1a unlocks 2a, 2a unlocks 3a, etc. If one were to do all B-Sides deathless, they can be done in any order, as unlocking them is irrespective of progression within the B-Sides themselves.

      "question": "What is the criteria for getting a full clear?",
      "answer": "Because of how different maps this can, this has the potential to vary. The most basic form of a full clear is obtaining all collectibles that do not represent a different challenge than the one being performed. For example, consider a map that has red berries, a cassette, a crystal heart, and a dashless golden berry. If one were to perform a full clear of the map, they would be required to collect the red berries, the cassette, and the crystal heart. The dashless golden berry represents a different challenge--doing the map dashless--and thus is not needed for a full clear. If it is impossible to get all the collectibles dashless, the dashless challenge would not contain a full clear flag. If it is possible, both the normal challenge and the dashless challenge will have full clear flags."

    "4": {
      "question": "What is the Top Golden List Rankings?",
      "answer": "The Top Golden List Rankings is a list of the hardest golden strawberry clears, where the minimum requirement to get on the list is to be harder than 'Hell Trio' from vanilla, which are the B-Side golden strawberries of chapters 6, 7, and 8. These are ordered by tier, so each color represents a different tier, and the higher up on the list means the harder it is. Please note that these are all decided subjectively by people with experience on the goldens, so these won't be perfectly accurate, and shouldn't be treated as such. The fewer people with the golden the more possible variance there is, so less popular goldens are more likely to be more inaccurate. It's intended to be our best estimate based on what the people who have done the goldens so far have said, so they're subject to change if and when more people do them. People generally try to base off a few things: their total playtime/experience with the game at the time of the golden, how much time they took on the map individually, and a more subjective analysis of the map's length, difficulty distribution, and gameplay consistency, among other things."
