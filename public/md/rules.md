# Map Rules

1. The map and/or map pack must be published on Gamebanana.com, or alternatively uploaded to [this archive.org item](https://archive.org/details/celeste-golden-list-removed-from-gb-maps).
2. The golden must pose some sort of challenge or difficulty, even if small (around the same difficulty as 1A). The map also must be at least 3 gameplay screens (or segments) long.
3. The map itself must not contain inappropriate visual or sound content, or any NSFW content.

# Golden Rules

1. Must have video that shows the whole completion from start to finish of the run. The video must be permanent and published somewhere where it can be watched (YouTube, Twitch, etc).
2. Usage of any gameplay affecting features is banned. These include but aren't limited to: Assist mode, Variant mode, Extended Variant mod, High Frame Rate Mod, etc. Debug is also banned unless it's used to get a golden on a map that doesn't have one by default (you may only use the give_golden command on the first screen of the map).
3. Show the endscreen if one exists in the map. If it doesn't, show the journal right after the run.
4. You must have raw recording of the run before it's verified, for Tier 3 and harder entries it's desirable to upload the raw recording together with the run itself.

## Recommendations

- Don't use features that significantly affect the visual part of the run (e. g. simplified graphics feature from CelesteTAS).
- Don't use mods that can give you some important information that you normally don't have access to (such as stamina meter or input history).
- Disable screenshake and turn photosensitive mode on.
- Use chapter timer or file timer.
- Use an input display. Make sure it's not minimized as some of them (like NohBoard) are known for not working in this case, make sure it's properly shown in the video before every session.
- Put the link to the map in description of the video.
- For video compilations with multiple maps, put a time stamp for each map.
- For Spring Collab 2020 or similar map packs, submit one video for each lobby and/or Heart Side golden for easier and faster verification.
- Sharing your progress publicly (via official Celeste Discord server or Celeste Modded Done Deathless Discord server) or otherwise documenting it somewhere helps credibility.
- Using pause buffering might result in putting a note on a golden clear, or rejecting a golden clear, depending on how aggressively pause was utilized in a run.

## Info

- When submitting a golden clear for a map that is already in the list, make sure that it follows all the rules for golden clear submissions. When submitting a golden clear for a map that is not in the list yet, make sure that the map follows the rules for maps as well as golden clear submission rules.
- There might be more rules for both golden clear submissions and maps that we didn't consider, so adding a golden clear or a map may be decided on a case by case basis.
- If a map pack has too many maps, then it may be listed in a separate page. For some map packs, all maps are tracked in a single cell and require a compilation video (you can also provide a link to the playlist if you have difficulties with making a single video).
- If the run doesn't follow some of the main rules, it might still get verified if it meets sufficient amount of recommendations to prove beyond any doubt that it's legit.
- A map may not be added to the list if a significant part of it resembles another map, both custom or from base game.

# Full Game Runs

- Those are challenge runs that involve completing multiple maps **(3 or more, runs that involve 2 maps can be accepted on case by case basis)** in a row without dying. Generally, they resemble one of the following (including but not limited to):
  - All A-Sides of the map pack without dying (All A-Sides Deathless) / All B-Sides of the map pack without dying (All B-Sides Deathless) / All C-Sides of the map pack without dying (All C-Sides Deathless);
  - All the A-Sides (or B-Sides/C-Sides/etc) of the map pack with all red berries/all collectibles without dying (All Red Berries deathless, All Full Clears Deathless);
  - Completing one lobby without dying, if the map pack uses lobby system (Lobby Deathless)
  - All maps of the map pack without dying (All Chapters Deathless);
  - All maps + all red berries/all collectibles of the map pack without dying (All Red Berries deathless, 100% Deathless)
- For full game runs there are two ways to make a verifiable run:
  1. Create a new file and complete the run. Some runs may require cheat mode to access certain maps, but if cheat mode isn't mentioned then it isn't allowed for the run.
  2. Get the golden berry on every map that's required for the run, without creating a new file. Some runs may only be possible to complete from existing file (e. g. Glyph Void-Side Moon Berry)."

## Rules

1. Must have a video that shows the run from creating a new file to completing the final chapter of the run. If you play from existing file, you must show chapter select screen of the first chapter of the run.
2. If you play from existing file, you must follow the order of chapters that would only be possible from a newly created save. Keep in mind heart gates and other similar measures that limit options of what chapters you can play at any moment.
3. You are not allowed to use Return to Map (Restart Chapter) option in order to avoid death. This also includes cases when you are on "safe ground" but can't proceed and finish a map by any means.
4. Using more than one save file in one run is not allowed.
5. If the run has forced deaths, you must not have more deaths than the minimum it takes to progress (for example, dying 2 times to one death warp isn't allowed if only 1 death is enough to progress).
6. Runs must be done in one play session.
7. Layout must not cover essential parts of the screen: timer, total berry counter in top left, berry tracker at the bottom, and save icon in bottom right.
8. Have **Full File Timer** enabled.
9. Refrain from long breaks if you're on menu (AFK during gameplay is acceptable but such breaks may cause suspicion if they are too long).

## Notes

- If some of the recommendations aren't followed, run still may get verified if enough additional proof is provided.
- Using hardcore mod isn't required.
- Collecting golden/silver berries is highly recommended if you're playing not from a new file.
- Full game run that doesn't get golden/silver berries may be submitted as individial golden/silver entries in other tabs, unless the map has gameplay exclusive for having a golden/silver berry (golden room, golden blocks etc).
